# Justin Schmitz - Personal Website

## Home Page

The purpose of the home page is to provide a summary of some of my public-facing work. Unfortunately, the best code I've written can't be publicly shared (whether for a corporation or for a class homework assignment), so the projects here aren't great. However, I'm pretty happy with the structure of "pretty image followed by a few paragraphs". 

## Resume

The resume page is a fairly faithful recreation of my print resume. I didn't include more detail about my jobs and classes, mostly because I covered everything I wanted to say in my print resume.

## General Styling

I'm pretty happy with the design overall. I wanted to avoid a stark white background, and I think the grey I picked accomplishes that. 

The things I'm most happy with: 

* Ease of use. I think the site is very usable and doesn't get in the way of getting the information out of it. Projects are easy to browse through, and navigation is quick and easy.
* Github links. This is a small thing, but thanks to Github having a transparent background, I was able to add a hover effect to those images that make it look like the inside of the cat "lights up", and I think it looks pretty cool. 

## Things I'd Change

* More clearly break up the header (with navbar) and the body content. Things somewhat blend together.
* The grey background kind of makes it looks like it's from 2006. I'm not a huge fan of this, but I couldn't come up with anything better.
* Interface that scales to mobile. Right now, once the viewport gets narrower than 500px or so, things go downhill pretty fast.
