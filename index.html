    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <section id="about">
      <p>
        I'm a software developer looking for back-end or systems-programming
        type roles. I'm comfortable in a variety of languages, and I pride
        myself on being able to efficiently teach myself new technologies and
        techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my personal life, when a pandemic <em>isn't</em> raging across the
        US, I'm a jazz pianist and singer. When I was in college, I was
        extremely active at Vandercook in their collegiate jazz ensembles.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently based in Chicago, but I'm looking to move out to the
        Pacific Northwest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to reach me is through email, at
        "justin[at]justinjschmitz[dot]com".

      <h3>IIT COVID-19 Dashboard</h3>

      <p>
        This project came out of wanting the university to provide some kind of
        COVID-19 dashboard for students. I didn't end up following through on
        maintainin the project due to university admin not providing useful
        data, but here's the site as it was built.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a useful excercise in learning front-end web development using
        React, but all of the styling is default Bootstrap styling.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't know anything about CSS when making the site, so the Jumbotron
        element is particularily hacked together - it's actually a rendered
        image created using Pillow, a Python image library, provided through the
        backend (FastAPI) and fed in as a background iamge. Yikes.
      </p>

      <h3>Automated Meal Cleanup Scheduling System</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/aepks/takedowns-projects"
        ><img src="assets\GitHub-Mark-64px.png"
      /></a>
      <p>
        I built a tool, along with a Flask front-end, to automatically generate
        fair schedules for takedowns.
      </p>

      <p>
        After every meal at the Fraternity house, three members are assigned to
        clean up after the meal, based on their class schedule. In the past,
        this was done by hand, and this tool successfully and fairly automated
        this process.
      </p>

      <p>The following constraints exist:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only one new member may be scheduled at each takedown.</li>
        <li>A member may only have one takedown in a 10 meal period.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The algorithm is based on a two-level greedy choice algorithm.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Get all available users who would be available for the takedown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then, we select the subset of this list that's done the smallest
          number of takedowns.
        </li>
        <li>
          We then order this list by the number of days since the previous
          takedown, in most to least, and take the first three subject to
          constraints.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        If we run out of users before the takedown is full, run the algorithm
        again, with all chosen users removed from the pool of all users.
      </p>

      <h3>Simulation of War</h3>

      <p>
        I simulated the card game War, and did some analytics on the results. My
        full write-up is too long for this site, but I'll include some of the
        tastiest image results from it.
